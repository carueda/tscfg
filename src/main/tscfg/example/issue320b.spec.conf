// GenOpts: --skip-gen4tests

# Example of a desirable case combining __ (for ignored objects) and @define.
# Unfortunately, TS Config issues prevent this from working as expected.

# A regular D class definition (to be reflected in generated code)
#@define
D = {
  d: double
}

# An ignored object intended for extension.
# TS Config issue: all comments here are lost; only the inherited
# comments from D get associated.
__A = ${D} {
  a: string
}

# These comment lines here are lost: TS Config only associates the
# inherited comments, and apparently only from the root D (I'm not
# even seeing the (intermediate) __A comments propagated for B).
#@define
B = ${__A} {
  b: boolean
}

# comment for someB
someB : B
